>###Research Abstract
>Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor, cognitive, and emotional functions. Monitoring and managing the symptoms of this multifaceted progressive disease is extremely challenging as it is limited by snap-shot clinical measures or patient self-reports approximately once every six months. Critical treatment decisions are made assuming that these snap-shots reflect a person s typical day-to-day functioning. Yet, PD symptoms are highly idiosyncratic and fluctuate hourly and daily, and can be difficult for a patient to convey to their clinician. Building on initial work carried out by our multidisciplinary team, this PhD project will begin the development a smartphone application to regularly monitor social isolation using combinatorial measures captured as a smartphone application. This application and the predictive model to be developed will enable a better-individualised measure of PD progression in terms of social isolation. Our hypothesis is that this will be more effective than standard methods. This project is to investigate Social Isolation in relation to Parkinson s Disease. We will develop Smart mobile technology to gauge Parkinson's progression in terms of social isolation, longitudinally and in the wild. And relate this measure to the Unified Parkinson s Disease Rating Scale (Non-motor aspects of Experiences of Daily Living). In this way, our work will be ecologically valid and grounded in existing practice. We take a combinatorial approach using image analysis of facial expressions, auditory analysis of vocalisations, and frequency and repetition of encountered Bluetooth signals. The science and novelty for this project is in the combined delivery of pre-existing image, auditory, and Bluetooth algorithms and the building of a statistically predictive model to assist health care professionals in understanding the onset of social isolation so that interventions can be made to address this onset earlier than usual.

## Projects
#### Data Mining of Outdoors and Social Routines of People with Parkinson's Disease
>- Dec. 2015 - Sept. 2016
>- Master Dissertation
>- Analyzed the geographic information and activities obtained from the mobile phone carried by Parkinson's patients by using various data processing methods, constructed the activity patterns of the patients through the machine learning method, obtained the activity status of the patients and applied the correlation study with the objective Parkinson's scales.

#### ECG Monitor and Patient Doctor Management System based on Android
>- Mar. 2015 - July 2015
>- Bachelor Graduation
>- Utilized the Bluetooth to receive the data form ECG monitor on patients’ bodies, drew ECG graph and calculated the heart rate of patient to help doctors to diagnose. Also implmented Baas service to store patient’s ECG data and transferred the ECG data instantly from patient to doctor, so doctor can manage basic information of patients.
